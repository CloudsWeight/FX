# fx
Foreign Exchange APIs using Oanda, Fed, and BEA data.  Leveraging MongoDB, FastAPI, and Node docker containers.

# FastAPI
- Deploy with Docker or run locally
- localhost:3333/ return currency random currency rate data
- To Dos:
  * create more API endpoints
  * create request parameters

# Everything else
Will be reworking and adding to api, mongo, and playwright as I get to it.
- API: currently a mess, should be converted to react with e-charts for real time data viz
- MongoDB: should be storage for currency rate and economic data to save load times and allowe persistance
